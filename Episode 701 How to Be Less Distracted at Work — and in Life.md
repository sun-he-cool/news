ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Alison Beard.

When you come to work each day it’s usually with the best of intentions. You’re going to fix that code, write that client proposal, finish those performance reviews, flesh out those strategy goals. But then you get an email notification or a slack message, or a call from a colleague and suddenly you’ve lost 30 minutes or an hour dealing with something that was much less important than the work you’d planned to do. You’ve been distracted.

This happens to so many of us, so many times a day. And our guest is an expert on this problem. Five years ago, he wrote a book telling companies how to build habit forming products – that is how to addict and distract us. In the years since he’s been studying how people can break those bad habits, not just with the devices we use, but also in our own minds.

He’s here today to offer advice for both individuals who want to be more focused and managers who want to create less distracted workplaces. Nir Eyal is the author of the book Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. Nir, welcome to the show.

NIR EYAL: Thanks so much Alison.

ALISON BEARD: So, you literally did write the book on how companies can develop phones and apps and websites that capture our attention, sometimes in unproductive ways. Now you’re telling us how to avoid getting distracted by them. Why the about-face?

NIR EYAL: Well, it’s not really an about-face as much as it is an insight that I have into both questions. Addiction is a very different thing from a habit because whereas addictions are always bad, habits can be very good. And so, what we want to do is to get the both of both worlds. We want to learn how to use habit forming technology to make our lives better and we also want to be aware of how these tools are built to make sure that we don’t go overboard.

ALISON BEARD: So, getting distracted by those products that are designed to take us away from the most important tasks of the day and to something that’s more like an entertainment or pleasure – that’s a habit we can break?

NIR EYAL: Yeah. I would actually say that those are the easy ones to break. It’s pretty obvious if you’re putzing around on YouTube or checking social media in the middle of your workday, that’s probably not what most knowledge workers should be doing with their time.

I think the much more pernicious distractions are the ones that we don’t even realize we are falling prey to. For example, this would happen to me all the time. I’d sit down at my desk and I’d say OK, now I’m going to do that big project, that thing I’ve been procrastinating, the thing that I’ve been putting off day after day. I’m finally going to sit down and do that project. Right after I check email.

And email feels work-y right? Isn’t email productive? That’s kind of a work type thing to do that you got to get done anyway, right? Well, not really because if we only do the things that are urgent and we don’t get to the things that are just as important, but may require some longer term planning, the things that we keep putting off day after day, we don’t get the most important tasks done.

And so, my goal with writing Indistractable was to help people turn their values into time. Most people will tell you the opposite of distraction is focus. It is not focus. The opposite of distraction is traction. So, both words come from the same Latin root, trahere, which means to pull and both end in the same six letter word: A-C-T-I-O-N. That spells action. So, traction is any action that pulls you towards what you want to do with your time. Things that you are doing with intent.

So, distraction is tricky right? Distraction in the moment feels like something we should be doing, even if it is not something we plan to do in advance. So, that’s what I want to help people do. Whatever it is you say you want to do, whatever it is that’s consistent with your values, that’s what I want to help you get done.

ALISON BEARD: So, really it all starts with planning?

NIR EYAL: Well that’s a big part of it. I actually would go a step further. So, let’s go, you know this question by the way, of why do we do things against our better interest? Why do we get distracted? This is an age-old question. Socrates and Aristotle called it akrasia. This tendency that we have to do things against our better interest. So, literally 2500 years ago people were saying, gosh isn’t the world such a distracting place these days?

And the seat of a few motivation, if you ask most people why do we do what we do? What defines human motivation? You’ll usually get some version of carrots and sticks. This is called Freud’s pleasure principle. That everything we do is about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.

It turns out neurologically speaking, that’s not true. That in fact, everything we do is not motivated by the desire to pursue pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but in fact it’s pain all the way down. This is called the homeostatic response. That anytime that we feel some kind of discomfort, that’s how the brain prompts us to act, to do something, to fix that uncomfortable sensation.

So, physiologically we know this is true. So, if you go outside and it’s cold, you put on a jacket. If you go back inside and now it’s too hot, you take it off. And psychologically that’s also true. That when we’re lonely, we check Facebook. When we’re uncertain we google. When we’re bored we check the news, stock prices, sports scores, you name it. All of these tools fundamentally cater to an uncomfortable sensation.

It’s called an internal trigger. So, that actually is the very first step because if we acknowledge that all human behavior is driven by a desire to escape discomfort, what that means is that time management is pain management. What’s changed, what’s different in the past several decades, is that if it is distraction that you seek, distraction you will find. It has become easier than ever to satisfy, to pacify those uncomfortable sensations because of the persuasive and pervasive nature of technology.

ALISON BEARD: You talked about the idea of really understanding what you want to do and what you want to get accomplished. But I can know that the most important thing for me to do today is edit an article, but also really not be able to handle that boredom and also have five emails to respond to and that’s a way of ticking five things off my checklist. How do I manage all of those struggles? How do I force myself to do the right thing?

NIR EYAL: There are four big pillars, four things that we can do to become indistractable. The first step has to be mastering those internal triggers and we can talk about how do we master those internal triggers. The second step is to make time for traction. We can go into more depth there. The third step is to hack back the external triggers. And finally the fourth step is to prevent distraction with pacts.

Most people fall into these two camps. I call them blamers and shamers. The shamers tend to say oh, it’s the technology doing it to me. I’m being manipulated. My brain is being hijacked and they blame the companies. The shamers think it’s them. They say, oh you see I’m lazy. I have an addictive personality. I have a short attention span and they shame themselves, telling themselves there’s something wrong with them. And it turns out neither of those are correct. That these are simply behaviors and behaviors can change if we implement these four tactics.

ALISON BEARD: How do we start to control those triggers?

NIR EYAL: Yeah. So, we start by recognizing that these sensations are completely normal. In the workplace setting, half the book is about things that you as an individual can do. But if you work in an environment where your boss demands that you respond to every beck and call, nights and weekends, well you have to do that or you lose your livelihood.

And so what we want to do is learn how to cope with those uncomfortable sensations in a way that leads us towards traction as opposed to distraction. So, there are three big tactics: reimagining the trigger, reimagining the tasks and reimagining our temperament.

And so one technique that I learned from acceptance and commitment therapy starts by simply acknowledging the sensation. If you can capture the preceding emotion before the distraction, did you check your phone because you’re feeling anxious, fearful, uncertain, fatigued, lonely? What was that underlying sensation that you were turning to your device or some kind of distraction for emotional pacification?

And what I want you to do is just write it down. Just write it down without judgment. Just acknowledge that sensation. Then the next step is to feel that sensation with curiosity instead of contempt. If you’re anything like I was, I would beat myself up whenever I got distracted. And many of us do this. We beat ourselves up and that is not helpful. In fact, it, studies have shown that this actually perpetuates the problem through rumination. What we want to do instead is to get curious instead of contemptuous with that feeling.

ALISON BEARD: But playing this out in a workplace context, I’m not focusing on the most important thing I need to do and I think to myself, why am I doing that? And if the answer is I’m not really interested in the work, or I don’t feel up for the work, how does that help you improve the situation?

NIR EYAL: So, that might be a situation where you may have to ask yourself, if you look at yourself in the mirror enough times per day and say, I hate this job. That might be something you want to fix, the first category, fix the source of the problem. Because these tactics are only so good. If fundamentally you are miserable in your job, in your relationship, in your home life, the problem isn’t the phone. The problem isn’t email. The problem is what’s going on in your life. So, that might be somewhere that you need a bit of introspection to say hey, is this job right for you.

ALISON BEARD: To be clear, I was speaking hypothetically. I enjoy my work.

NIR EYAL: I don’t want to get a call from your boss. Yes, of course. But absolutely. So, it however, for most folks they say yeah, my job’s fine. I’m good. Home life is fine. But this one particular thing I have to do today is kind of driving me up the wall. I don’t really want to do it.

And so, this is where you might implement one of these tactics of saying wait, why don’t I want to do this? What is difficult about this? Is it boredom? Is it that it’s fatiguing me? Is it that it’s a, I’m not certain this is worth doing? And just writing down that sensation, exploring that sensation with curiosity and then using this last thing we want to do, is called the 10 minute rule. Where literally I will pick up my phone and I will say to my phone, set a timer for 10 minutes. I’ll put the phone back down and my job is to just sit with that sensation for a few minutes with curiosity. And this is called surfing the urge.

Because what we know from acceptance and commitment therapy is that these sensations, these uncomfortable emotional states, they crest and then they subside much quicker than you think. And so, in those 10 minutes you have two choices. You can either get back to the task at hand, or sit with that sensation. At the end of those 10 minutes, you can give into whatever it is you want.

This is not about abstinence. This is about acknowledging you can do that thing that you want to do, whether it’s eat the piece of chocolate cake, or check a slack channel, or check email, or YouTube video, whatever it is that takes you off track, you can do it in 10 minutes. And you would be amazed how just becoming conscious of those sensations for just 10 minutes and surfing the urge, nine times out of 10 it will crest and subside. So, that’s one of the three big techniques. Reimagining the internal trigger. We can also reimagine the task and we can also reimagine our temperament.

ALISON BEARD: So, now let’s talk about external triggers. The chatter in an open office, a client calling unexpectedly, your boss emails you. do you deal with that especially when some of them actually are urgent? They need to be answered right away?

NIR EYAL: Yeah, so the first step is about mastering the internal triggers. There’s one step we skipped which is about making time for traction which is about making what’s called a timebox calendar. So, assuming you have made that timebox calendar, and we can walk into exactly how to do that and what we have to do to keep that useful, such as there’s this technique called schedule syncing that we can discuss as well.

Now what you’re going to do is to make sure that you turn off the external triggers that don’t serve you. Remember if an external trigger prompts you to do something you wanted to do, let’s say it’s your alarm clock saying OK. Now it’s time to get up and go to the gym, or a notification saying OK, it’s time for that call, or that meeting you had. Well these are very helpful external triggers. The technologies are wonderful in that respect. They help us remember to do the things we wanted to do.

But if the external trigger prompts you to do something you didn’t want to do, well now it’s a distraction. So, the first step is to define what is traction for you, and what distraction for you is. And it’s about carving out that time in your day to make sure that you do the things that you really want to do on your schedule, as opposed to your boss’s schedule, your kid’s schedule, your spouse’s schedule.

So, to do that we have to hack back these external triggers and I use the term hack back because in my first book it was about how to build habit forming products. And there’s no doubt that these companies are using your psychology to hack your attention.

However, that doesn’t mean we can’t hack back. And so, I talk about in my book, these eight different environments where we might experience these pings, dings and rings that take us off track. And the obvious ones are our phones, our computers, but that’s kindergarten stuff. That’s actually very easy, even though two thirds of Americans never change their notification settings on their smartphone. Two thirds of people never change the notifications. It drives me crazy. Take the 10 minutes for God sakes to change the notification settings so that people can’t just reach you whenever they want to so that you use these products on your schedule as opposed to the app maker’s schedule.

ALISON BEARD: I will tell you that I tried to today, set up an out of office reply on my email to say that I can’t respond to every pitch for an article, or an idea. But then I felt it was going to be rude for the people who I was actually wanting to email with and so, I abandoned the pursuit.

NIR EYAL: OK. So, there’s a few, let’s dive into email. So, it’s interesting that you mentioned, as soon as you said you implemented this technique, you immediately followed up with a feeling. Right, so email is the mother of habit-forming technology because it uses all of these quirky psychological biases that we have. Like this idea that we want to reciprocate. If someone puts out their hand to shake your hand, you feel compelled to shake it without even thinking, just out of habit.

And so, we have that same sensation when it comes to email with this asynchronous communication channel. When someone sends you an email, you feel like you need to reply to it. But do you? The fact is someone as busy as you doesn’t need to reply to every single person. The person who doesn’t get the reply will be perfectly all right.

ALISON BEARD: So, you’ve referenced timeboxing a lot and that is something that I’ve heard before from other people advising on time management. Scheduling syncing was a new idea to me. So, explain that for our listeners and how one might do it both at work and at home.

NIR EYAL: The process starts by realizing that to do lists are not good enough. That we’ve heard that to be productive you have to write a to do list. Write everything down and somehow they magically get done. When? I don’t know.

When I used to do day after day after day was half my to do list would not get done. It would get moved over and recycled to the next day and the next day and the next day, and you’ve heard that quote that insanity is defined as doing the same thing day after day and expecting different results. This was insane. I mean I did this for years.

And what I didn’t realize is that your to do list is the output. That’s what you want to do. But having output without input makes no sense. What is the input for a knowledge worker our input is time. So, that means that we need to budget for when we want to do everything on our to do list. Putting it on our to do list is just step one. The next step has to be when are you going to do that task?

Now once you’ve done that this becomes a very, very powerful tool. Because then we can do what’s called schedule syncing. Once you have a timebox calendar, they can take that calendar to their boss and say, hey look. Here’s what I have, here’s what I’m doing with my week. How does this look? OK. So it looks all right? My priorities are correct. By the way you also asked me to do these six other things. Now, my schedule’s full. Which one should I swap out? What is more of a priority?

This is a life-changing practice because most managers and employees have kind of accepted this crazy relationship that we have where we just lob work over to each other and say do this, do this, do this with no appreciation for is there time to do these things?

And it frees up your time for the other areas of your life. It’s not fair that if we don’t finish work at work, that the default is well it has to come home with us for nights and weekends. That’s not fair. We enter into a trust pact with our employer that we say we will give you X amount of hours and the employee expects X amount of hours for a certain amount of pay. But if our work keeps expanding outside of work, and we’re not getting compensated for that.

And so of course there are some professions where you just have to expect that. If you’re going to work at a startup, if you’re going to work on Wall Street, you know what you’re signing up for. You’re signing up for a 60-80 hour weeks. That’s totally fine if that’s part of your value system, go for it. It’s these other jobs where people say yeah, this is a 40 hour a week workplace, when it’s not. Because so much work is happening outside of work. That is a lie. And that we can end. We can clarify by having this schedule syncing on a weekly basis.

ALISON BEARD: Well, one thing that struck me as I was reading the book and starting to think about this topic is that we struggle so much with being distracted at work, but then when we leave the office we’re also distracted by work. So, it’s almost like we’re just not doing the right things at the right time. When you have all of those competing demands, probably which add up to more than 24 hours a day – how do you prioritize?

NIR EYAL: So, it starts with our values. Values are the attributes of the person we want to become. I’m patient zero, by the way with all this stuff. I didn’t write this book because I have good self-control. Quite the opposite. I wrote this book because I need to have good self-control and I always struggle with distraction until I did this research over the past five years.

So, if you asked folks, myself included, what do you value? What’s important to you in your life? Well, I would tell you my family, my friends, my health. Those things are important to me. But if you looked at my calendar you would say, where is the time for that?

And so that’s why this process must start with our values, starting from us. If we don’t take care of ourselves, we can’t take care of others, we can’t do our best work. The first step is to look at your calendar, look at that blank slate and to ask yourself, how much time do I need to take care of myself? To have sufficient sleep? To cook healthy meals if that’s important to you?

We also want to make time for the practicalities of life, commuting and all the things that take up our day. Then we want to layer in the time for relationships. We all say that relationships with friends and families important, but where is that time on our calendar?

And then finally we want to do the work domain. Where not only do we want to make sure we have time for the reacted tasks like messages and emails and things like that. We also have to make time for the reflective work. That we know that it’s very difficult for a knowledge worker to progress their career unless they have time to think. If our output as knowledge workers is coming up with creative solutions to hard problems, you can’t do that fluttering between emails and meetings all day.

We all only have 24 hours per day. But what this forces us to do is to figure out which values, which of our values compete with each other. Just to be clear, you can schedule time for whatever you want.

ALISON BEARD: Yeah. For bigger picture goals, sort of a larger, more holistic time management, you talk about making pacts with yourself and with others in fact. What are those kinds of pacts?

NIR EYAL: Sure. So, this is the last technique out of the four, so after we’ve mastered internal triggers and after we’ve made time for traction, after we’ve hacked back the external triggers, and by the way, I’m giving you the 30,000 foot overview. There’s a lot more little tactics here that we didn’t get time for, but the last of the four big strategies here is to prevent distraction with pacts.

And pacts are a 2500, at least 2500 hundred year old technique. The first recorded use of a pre-commitment of a pact comes to us form the story of Ulysses, written, the story by Homer over 2500 years ago.

The idea is basically that you pre-commit to do something now, so that you don’t get distracted in the future. So, if you think about how we setup a 401(k) account, a retirement account with stiff penalties if you withdraw your money early. That’s a form of a pre-commitment. If you think about an effort pack, an effort pack might be something that puts a bit of friction between you and the thing you don’t want to do.

So, in my household, we found that my wife and I were not going to bed on time. Night after night we would not get to bed on time because we’d still be checking email, or social media, or whatever. And so, we entered into this effort pact by going to the hardware store and buying ourselves a five dollar outlet timer. Whatever you plug into this outlet timer will turn off at a certain time day or night.

So, every night in our household, at 10 p.m. the internet shuts off. Now, I could go in there and fondle with this little timer and turn it back on, but I put a little effort in between me and something I don’t want to do. I don’t want to get distracted by keeping, checking email all night. I want to go to bed because getting proper rest and taking care of my body is one of my values.

Now you can also do a price pact. You can put some kind of cost to not doing the thing you want to do. And then the final type of pact is called an identity pact. And this is probably the most powerful of the three. This comes out of the research around the psychology of religion and how we know when people form a particular identity around a certain behavior set, that behavior becomes much easier to do.

A devout Muslim doesn’t say to themselves, hmm, I wonder if I should have that beer today. No. Devout Muslims don’t drink alcohol. It’s no longer an issue. It doesn’t require any contemplation or self-control. It’s just something they don’t do. And so, that’s why it’s so important to come up with this new moniker for ourselves. So, that when we do these slightly strange behaviors, like not respond to every email we receive, Alison. We can say to folks, you know what, I’m sorry I’m indistractable. So you can even put that in your autoreply.

ALISON BEARD: Right. Well that brings us back to the workplace though because company culture sometimes doesn’t allow for that kind of behavior. I know some workplaces where it would seem very rude not to answer an email or a direct message on something like Slack. Or, to not be available to your bosses and clients just sort of at a moment’s notice. So, what can you do if your manager or your organization doesn’t buy into this?

NIR EYAL: I’m so glad you brought this up because I’m thinking a lot of people as they are listening to this are saying, OK that’s easy for you to do, but you haven’t come to my place of work. Exactly. This is a revelation. Because, think about what we’re saying here. Is it the technology that’s doing it to us? Or, is it the workplace culture that’s doing it to us?

Distraction at work is a symptom of cultural dysfunction. And it’s funny that you should mention Slack. So, Slack was this company. For those of you who don’t use it, it’s the world’s largest group chat app. And this product kept coming up when people complained to me about distraction, they would say I’m constantly tethered to Slack and if it’s not Slack, its email or something else. But Slack was one of these things that people kept mentioning.

So, I went and paid Slack a visit. And I learned something amazing. You would think that if technology was the source of the problem, if Slack is what made people distracted all day long, people at Slack should be the most distracted people on earth. They use Slack more than everyone. And yet that wasn’t the case.

If you go to Slack headquarters at 6 p.m., it’s empty. Nights and weekends, nobody uses Slack. And what I discovered was that this problem of distraction doesn’t occur in companies that have a healthy workplace culture. Because here’s the thing. Distraction is a problem. Nobody likes it. And yet if we can’t talk about the problem, there’s something going on in that workplace environment that makes people not want to talk about their problems.

What we find is that these companies that don’t struggle with distraction, where employees are happy with how connected they are to their technologies and don’t feel like they’re constantly pressured into this horrible cycle of responsiveness. These companies exhibit three traits. And these three traits have nothing to do with the technology. The three traits are the company gives employees a sense of psychological safety. Psychological safety means you can air concerns without fear of retribution. You’re not going to get fired if you raise your hand and say hey, do we like constantly being tethered to our devices at 7 p.m., 8 p.m. at night? Is this working for folks?

If you can do that at a company, if you can raise your hand and voice a concern, that’s part of what psychological safety is all about. The second trait is that they not only give employees psychological safety, they also make sure that they have a forum to discuss their issues and questions, and concerns.

So, at Slack it’s fascinating. They actually use Slack in a very interesting way. They have these channels. One of them is called Beef Tweets where people can air beef with the company. And employees will go to this forum, they’ll say something they’re not happy with about the company or the product or whatever they have a concern about, and the employee management will use, get this, emoji to acknowledge that those responses have been viewed. So, they’ll leave an eye emoji that means that OK, we’ve seen that. We acknowledge it. All right. Check mark, to show folks that somethings being done about the problem. Because giving employees a sense of agency and control is incredibly important.

And number three, and most importantly, it’s the companies where management exemplifies what it means to be indistractable that don’t have this problem. So, it’s one thing if you talk the talk. But unless you as a manager walk the walk as well and say no, no, I want you to shut off because I shut off. I need time for reflection as well. That is the kind of company that exemplifies this kind of culture where people don’t continually get distracted. So, the big takeaway here is that distraction is a symptom of cultural dysfunction, but culture can change.
