ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Alison Beard.

If you’ve listened to this show before, or are a close follower of HBR, you know a couple of things. One, to succeed in today’s workplace, you need to always be learning, adapting, and growing. Your current knowledge and skills will only get you so far.

Two, we feel more stressed and crunched for time than ever. How do we fit all of this necessary self-improvement into our lives while also trying to balance the daily demands of a job, outside activities, personal obligations, and ideally at least a bit of rest? Today’s guest says the answer might be something called “ultralearning”, a strategy for developing expertise in areas from coding to foreign languages, to public speaking, extremely quickly.

Scott Young is the author of the book Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career. Scott, thanks so much for being on the show.

SCOTT YOUNG: Oh yeah, it’s great to be here.

ALISON BEARD: So, how exactly do you define ultralearning? How different is it from cramming for a test, or speedreading?

SCOTT YOUNG: Right, so I wouldn’t define it in terms of being like cramming a test or speedreading. Rather the way that I looked at it is finding people who have accomplished really impressive things with self-directed learning projects, not going to a school and having to spend four years in university, or even longer if you’re doing grad school, but teaching themselves the skills that they wanted to have.

And often what they would be focused on was how do they get exactly what they need. So, whether that was public speaking, or programming, or building a business, they were focused on acquiring what would help them the most. And that’s often how you can learn something more quickly is if you are directing it towards what you care about, and what you really want to master, not just someone who’s made some arbitrary curriculum.

ALISON BEARD: And how did you get interested in this style of learning?

SCOTT YOUNG: My kind of first introduction into this was actually during a moment of struggle. So, I was in university, and I was living in France, I had a chance to go study abroad for a year, and I was really keen to learn French.

And it turned out that it was actually really difficult. I really struggled to learn French, and I found that most of the people around me spoke to me in English all the time. I was kind of discouraged about this. And I was chatting with a friend from back home, and I was sort of saying it’s so hard to learn French, and it takes so long, and it’s so difficult. And he said, well, have you heard of Benny Lewis. So, Benny Lewis has a website very modestly titled “Fluent in Three Months”. Now Benny speaks about, I think 10 plus languages, especially now he’s learned some even in the intervening years since this story took place. And I was just blown away by this is someone who’s not just trying to learn languages, and not just learning them effectively, but he has this very intense and ambitious goal.

And so, meeting him was sort of my first introduction in this world of ultralearning, or of people who take on very aggressive and intense learning projects to learn things quite quickly. Since then I’ve met a lot of people in different domains that convinced me that this is a more general approach than just learning languages.

ALISON BEARD: So, if you’re thinking about ways to boost your career, how do you pick exactly the right thing to learn that’s going to help you advance in the way that you want? Is it something that’s clearly connected to your job now, or something you think you might need years in the future?

SCOTT YOUNG: Just being in the mindset of focusing on learning, regardless of whether the skill you’re learning is exactly the best skill that you should be learning, or whether it’s just this might be useful, and then it ends up becoming helpful later on, I think the attitude of orienting your career around always learning, and always having a learning project, and always upgrading your skills is very valuable.

However, I think there are two ways you can approach it. One way is to try to figure out what would be the best skill for you to learn right now. And a technique that’s very valuable for that is what we call the expert interview method.

The expert interview method is basically look at people who are two to three steps ahead of you in your career that you want to go to in the future. So, that could be they have the job that you want to have, they have the level of prestige that you’d like to have, they’re doing the kind of work that you’d like to be doing, and talk to them, and figure out what was their career trajectory, how did they progress in their current career so you can look at what kinds of skills might have played a factor in there.

Maybe when they were transitioning from let’s say technical work to a leadership position, they had to learn a lot of soft skills. Or maybe they have to go from being okay in a particular domain to being one of the best.

But the other thing I think is valuable is just embarking on these kinds of projects can be valuable, even if you don’t spend a ton of time doing research figuring out what the best possible skill is.

So, one of the gentlemen that I had a change to work with in researching for this book did his project about public speaking. And the funny thing about the project is that he didn’t have some real strong desire to become this great public speaker, he was just thinking, you know what, maybe public speaking would be useful.

And he ended up doing this very intensive learning project over a period of about seven months where he was speaking multiple times a week, sometimes even twice a day, he was getting feedback from various sources, using all of the principles I discuss in the book. And he went from having very little experience, maybe only having done a handful of speeches in his entire life, to being a finalist for the World Championship of Public Speaking, which is a conference put on by Toastmasters every year where 32,000-plus people compete to get the top spot for best public speaker.

And the funny thing about this wasn’t just that he was able to achieve this result, but it effected essentially an entire career change that he and the person he was working with on this project ended up becoming public speaking consultants, and forming a business around it.

And so, I think this is also an example how if you just pick a skill that might be valuable, and you really take it seriously, and really explore what it means to get good at it, it can often lead to opportunities that you don’t even foresee in advance.

ALISON BEARD: So, I bet you can anticipate this question based on my introduction, but how on earth are we supposed to find the time for this? Especially people who are busy executives, people who have huge family commitments?

SCOTT YOUNG: So, I actually think this is the opposite. I think this is more relevant to people who have bigger time constraints. Most of the traditional options for getting education are the most time consuming and difficult to fit into your life. So, consider going back to university to get an undergraduate degree, that’s like at least four years. Or even an MBA, or an executive MBA program, you’re plunking down at least a year or two, and considerable amounts of money in addition to that in order to learn new skills.

People who have the least time, the people who have the most time constraints, those are the ones that really have to be efficient with figuring out what is the most effective way to learn this skill. And so, throughout this book I’ve included a lot of stories, and I’ve often picked people who their accomplishments are very impressive, because I think they are often the clearest example of well, they were doing something that worked, something about what they were doing worked so we can kind of analyze it and kind of figure out what they were actually doing.

But in terms of the principles, or in terms of what I think are the effective strategies, none of them are really about well, you have to spend 80 hours a week doing this, or you have to block off a year of your life, but rather they’re about what are you doing with each hour, or what are you doing with each ten-minute chunk you have available to learn?

ALISON BEARD: And you yourself were a relatively normal person before you became this expert on ultralearning, and put yourself through all these different projects from languages to coding, etcetera. So, tell me a little bit about your own experiences, you know, first learning this language, and then picking up other skills along the way.

SCOTT YOUNG: Sure. So, the MIT challenge was a project that I took in 2011. And basically I had just graduated from university at the time. I studied business in business school. And I was feeling a little bit of regret about what I chose to study because I had always had these ambitions of being an entrepreneur, particularly doing stuff in software, and the Internet, and online things, and I kind of wanted to study computer science.

And so, around this time I found some classes that were posted by MIT online. So, MIT has a platform called Open Courseware that they put basically their, quite a few of their classes, a majority maybe, of their classes, have some material online that are from the actual MIT classes. So, there’s recorded videos of the lectures, there’s assignments with solution keys, there’s final exams with solution keys.

And so, this kind of experience having met Benny Lewis, and him taking on these intensive projects involving learning, and then exposed to this class kind of got me thinking has anyone tried to simulate an MIT degree before, like do something using their free materials that tries to represent what you would learn in an MIT degree?

And so, I built this curriculum that had 33 classes that was pretty close to what an MIT student would take. A good benchmark would be could I pass the final exams and do the programming projects for that class? And so, this was a project that I decided to undertake. And in addition to that, those constraints of working with the free materials from home, I wanted to try to do it in 12 months.

And I felt that from some of the things I learned not only from Benny Lewis, but from my own sort of private experiments with learning, that it might be possible to do it more effectively than going to school because you have a lot more options and flexibility with using the material.

So, just some examples to that, normally if you’re going to a class and sitting in a lecture, you have to show up at the scheduled time, you have to sit through the whole thing, even when the professor’s shuffling their papers, or they’re going on a little bit of a rant.

Whereas when you are at home you can just watch the video whenever you’re ready, and you can watch it at 1.5 times the speed. And if you ever good confused you can just pause it and hit rewind. Or things like assignments when normally you do a whole assignment, and you struggle through it, and you submit it, and you wait a week, and then you get your feedback, you can just do one problem and then if you don’t know the answer you go to the solution, and then you learn that problem, and it helps you with the second problem, and then the third problem, and so you get that tighter feedback loops that allow you to learn a little bit more quickly than waiting weeks to get your answer.

ALISON BEARD: That makes sense. Okay, so I want to dig into some of the specific principles that people can use to learn this way. You say that you first need to learn how to learn the subject you’ve chosen, which is meta. You call it meta learning. So, how do people go about doing that?

SCOTT YOUNG: Right. So, I think this is very important because obviously when you are taking on a learning project on your own, this is a bit of a catch-22 that the people who normally design curricula, they already know the subject, so they kind of have some sense of well, you have to start learning this, and then you have to learn that.

This obviously makes it an advantage for going to school or taking a class. Whereas if you are learning something on your own, you often don’t know exactly what you need to learn, or what you have to do. So, this involves I think a difficulty that you can get around by spending some time first, before you start learning things, before you crack open a book, before you start a course, before you start working on your own project, you spend a little bit of time figuring out what exactly is the skill I want to acquire, and how have other people learned in the past?
What resources are available?

And this is easier than I think a lot of people give credit. You can just go online and do some Google searches. So, for skills that are popular like programming, languages, public speaking, MBA, business skills, there will be many, many resources. If you do a Google search you will find many, many things that pop up, and that you can use these resources.

But at the same time I think that once you’ve done maybe half an hour, hour of research, and you’ve found some of these resources, then you can move on to using the expert interview method that I talked about before where you can find people who have learned the skill, and really ask them, okay, if you were starting from scratch how would you approach learning this? And this is often extremely valuable because a lot of resources that are out there maybe aren’t the best for learning that skill.

ALISON BEARD: You talked a few times about direct practice, hands on experience, so why is jumping into direct practice so important before you even spend a lot of time studying? And how do you even find those opportunities when you’re new at something, and probably shouldn’t even be trusted to do what you’re doing? For example, in a workplace setting?

SCOTT YOUNG: Right, exactly. Well, this is something that has been very interesting to me because if you look at the literature on what is known as transfer. So, transfer of learning is when you learn something in one context, let’s say from a book, or a classroom, and then you want to apply it in a different context, let’s say in real life.

And there has been basically studies that go back really over 100 years that show that this is more difficult than people assume. That people tend to assume that when you learn a skill, that you’ll learn it in a very general way, that you’ll be able to flexibly use it in all sorts of situations, and that’s just not what psychologists and educational researchers find. They find that when people learn something, not only do they tend to learn it in fairly narrow ways, so they can only really do the kinds of problems that they were explicitly trained on, at least in the beginning, but also that they tend to stay welded to the situation that they learned it in.

So, you can teach someone something in a classroom, and then give them an application, an obvious application in real life, and they may fail to think of the knowledge that they learned in that classroom example. And so, the ultra-learners that I met, the people who are very successful at learning combat this problem by doing the opposite, by doing direct practice where they figure out where they want to use the skill, where is this actually going to make impact with my life, where do I think I will be using this knowledge, where will it come up, and then try to design practice scenarios that imitate this quite closely.

And so, the easiest way to do that obviously is to just do the thing that you want to do. So, if you are trying to learn a language, and you want to have conversations, have conversations with people. If you want to learn programming in order to build a website, start working on a little project to build a website.

Even if it’s just a mock project, or a toy project, that is maybe not the full website you’d like to build, or the full conversation you’d like to have, it will still imitate it enough that when you learn things in that context it will transfer better and be more useful in future use.

Now sometimes, as you mentioned, this is impossible. Maybe you’re not qualified to do the real thing, and so people really restrict you from working in that scenario. And so, in this way you have to be a bit creative, you have to try to design projects that will simulate it enough so that you will be able to get the benefit of that learning.

So, one of the examples I talk about in this book is a fellow by the name of Vat Jaiswal, who he was going into architecture. And unfortunately a lot of the architecture skills that he learned in school were very theoretical, they were very abstract, and they weren’t helping him get a job. He didn’t have the skills that were actually being practiced, so employers that were considering him were like no, you’re not useful to us, and we’re in a bit of a tough situation right now, we don’t want to hire you.

And so, what he decided to do was work on his own portfolio, his own project, doing basically the kinds of buildings that he saw that they were designing. So, he got a job at a large form print shop where they print blueprints, and he studied the blueprints to see how they put the buildings together, how they annotate things, how they document their designs, and then he trained himself on the actual software they used, which in this case was a software called Revit.

And so, this is an example by where simulating the environment, by trying to match the features that you’re actually trying to learn in as closely as possible, he was able to learn very useful and very practical skills, as opposed to let’s say just reading a dozen books about architecture and going back and trying to apply for those jobs, and still not having the practical skill despite maybe spending dozens or hundreds of hours doing that.

ALISON BEARD: Yeah. Both this idea of practicing something before you’re good at it, and a few of the other principles, drilling yourself on your weaknesses, testing your retrieval and recall, and then especially soliciting critical corrective feedback, all of that sounds very ego bruising. So, how do you push through all of that? Does it require a certain personality? Someone that doesn’t get frustrated?

SCOTT YOUNG: So, it can be frustrating but I think a lot of it is about expectations and mindset. So, if you go in with the expectation that this is going to be really challenging, I’m trying to do something difficult, and out of the ordinary, and isn’t the status quo, and I’m going to experience failure, I’m going to be bad at this in the beginning, if you frame your project that way, and just say to yourself that’s okay, that’s why I’m doing it, it’s a lot easier to experience these moments.

And so, for example, in one of the projects that I took on involved learning languages, and it involves speaking with people and only trying to speak that language from the very first moment that we got off the plane in the country we were trying to learn in. And of course this sounds really scary to most people when we talk about this method.

However, if you approach it from the perspective of okay, I’m going to be bad at this, and when I talk to people I’m going to maybe learn a phrase or two to say this is what I’m doing, and this is why I’m doing it, and suddenly it changes the situation. Now suddenly people become supportive of you, and they understand what you’re trying to do, and they try to encourage you.

When you’re approaching these projects, a lot of it is about framing, that a lot of us want to have a solution for learning that is pain free, that there’s no frustration, that there’s no difficulty, and so we opt for ways of practicing that are let’s say not very direct, that involve no feedback, that don’t actually really stress and train our mental muscles so to speak. And because of this we don’t actually learn very much, or we learn at a sort of a slower pace than we could otherwise.

ALISON BEARD: So, I mentioned cramming earlier and that is because I will confess that I was a terrible crammer in college, I used to study the day before a test, spit everything back up pretty well. I would get good grades. But then I would forget it all by the next semester. So, when people embark on these projects, it sounds like a lot of the learning techniques might prevent that forgetting from happening, but are there other things you can do to make sure that once you’ve developed this expertise, this new skill, new knowledge, that you’re retaining it all?

SCOTT YOUNG: Yeah. So, one of the things that you mentioned I think is borne out by the research, and that is that if you learn something in a short period of time, what psychologists called mass practice where you do the same thing over and over again, or you learn it over and over and over again in the same studying session, you do have over a very short period of time somewhat better performance.

So, there’s a reason why students tend to cram for exams. But then it drops off precipitously. You don’t have as long-term memory. And so, one of the most robust findings from the psychology of learning is the spacing effect. Which says that if you learn something over separate intervals, so you have exposure to the same information over multiple different intervals over a longer period of time, then the skill and knowledge that will be involved will last much longer.

And so, there are different ways that you can approach this. And one of the simple ways is that when you are learning something, that you want to, as much as possible, spread out the exposures to that information. So, how we typically handle things is you’ll learn unit one, and then you’ll focus all on unit one, and then go on to do unit two, and you only do unit two.

Whereas psychology says that when you go to unit two, maybe you should do a little bit a revisal of unit one. At unit three you should do a little bit of a revisal of unit one, and then unit two. And so, you can do this in a kind informal way. If you’re reading books you can just sort of look over some of your notes, or you can practice a little bit with some of the questions, which is even better.

Or if you have a really memory intensive subject you want to learn like languages, or law, or anatomy, and you have a lot of things that you need to keep in memory, then there are actual software systems you can use called space repetition systems. A really popular one is the free open source one named Anki, A-N-K-I.

And these things are essentially flash card management software. So, you can turn your knowledge, the things, the questions that you want to retrieve, into flash cards, and they will actually set up an algorithm for you to set up your review for that. So, if you have something that you want to learn it will actually schedule in the future times to review that information so that you will ensure that you don’t forget it, and you can maintain that knowledge over a longer period of time.

Another thing that you can do, which has been shown by psychology is known as over learning, or proceduralization. And this is the idea that when you learn something the first time, often what our goal is is to get to knowing the information. So, getting to the point where you can let’s say solve a problem once, so apply the information once. And what has been shown is if you do further practice beyond this, so if you over learn the information, doing beyond what you need to do to just first master it, then this has an impact on the longevity of the skill, so that you’ll retain it for a longer period of time.

And one of the examples of this that I find really interesting is that there was a study on students who learned algebra. What they looked at was the decay rate, or how people forgot algebra over the intervening years and decades. And what they found is that those that scored high on the test, or scored low on the test, had the same rate of forgetting.

That means that people who scored really well, they knew more, so they also knew more later on, but if you look at the slope, or how quickly they forgot things, it was basically the same between the best performing students, and the weaker performing students.

However, there was an exception. Those who went on to do calculus had a much shallower rate of forgetting. So, they didn’t forget as much as those who had just done this algebra class. And so, this suggests that if you overlearn it, which you would do if you took your algebra skills and applied it in an even more difficult context where you have to do algebra all the time, then this can result in a more robust effect from memory.

ALISON BEARD: So, we’ve talked a lot about how individuals can become ultra-learners themselves, do you see a way that organizations can use this strategy for training and development of lots of people?

SCOTT YOUNG: Yeah, so I think one of the things that’s often a challenge with learning skills is that you need to be competent in order to work and actually train in the area that you’re working in. So, often you don’t even let someone get near a project until they already have the skills to work on it.

And so, I think one of the ways that we’ve tried to fix this in our society is by having increasingly large educational requirements. And the challenge is that this often, this educational root, often suffers from some of these problems. That it’s not very direct, that you’re often learning things that don’t have much connection with the actual job, or maybe you’re learning some abstract things, but you’re not learning a lot of specifics. And so there are difficulties with this approach.

And I think actually that the older system of the master and apprentice model was a better model for learning for things. And so I think the more you can foster that in your organizational environment where you have people who want to learn a skill, and they are going to learn it in conjunction with someone who already knows it, so someone who they can do work on it, and they can work towards, but then they can also have someone who actually knows the skill, look at what they’re doing, offer feedback, and that they can actually legitimately participate in this environment.

So, they can actually do work that is in the kind of environment that they need to do the work, this is going to be a lot more direct than let’s say going and doing some classroom problems that maybe aren’t that related to what you’re actually doing at work for a number of years before then going back and then trying your hand at doing it.

ALISON BEARD: What other ways can managers help their employees become ultra-learners?

SCOOT YOUNG: Yeah. So, I think one of the things that you can do is encourage people to take on projects where learning is an explicit goal of that project. And again, I think that is often difficult because we have organizational objectives where people are trying to accomplish things.

But I think if you can create space so that people think of one of their jobs in your organization as being learning, as upgrading their skills, as adding new skills to their toolkit, if you can view that as being an important part of their work life, then they will be more likely to take on some of those projects.

And so similarly to how Google had their famous 20 percent rule where employees work on their own projects, I think it would also be beneficial to allocate some time to learning projects. So, that if someone says, you know what, I’m a great programmer, but I would like to work on my public speaking, or I would like to work on this new tool that I don’t know right now, then not only being explicit about allowing people to work on those projects, but also being clear that the goal is learning, the goal is for them to acquire new skills. So that means that it might mean that in the beginning they’re not producing the most useful work, but you still encourage that as an organization I think is very important.

One strategy that I’ve heard people talk about is just having let’s say quarterly learning goals. So, you say this quarter what is the new skill that you’re going to acquire. It doesn’t have to be a big thing. It doesn’t have to be well, I’m going to be fluent in Mandarin Chinese, it could be something simple like, you know what, I want to learn how Excel macros work so that I can optimize some of my accounting work. That’s a really good goal.

ALISON BEARD: What is a good first step for someone who might want to try ultralearning, embark on one of these projects, but sort of feels overwhelmed either by the choice of what they should focus on, or how exactly to go about it?

SCOTT YOUNG: My advice is to start small. So, I think if you can start by picking a very concrete, and very specific skill that you’d like to learn, that this can give you some of the tools for not only figuring out okay, what strategies worked, and which didn’t in order to learn this particular skill, but also in self-management in how do you manage your time, how do you allocate space in your life to actually acquire these skills, and make progress, and check in on yourself.

And so, I think the people that experience the most success are those that usually focus on something concrete, specific, and something that will have a meaningful impact in your life. So, I used the example of Excel macros, which are these little mini programming things you can do to speed up using Excel, and this is something that if you use spreadsheets in your life, if you’re an analyst, if you’re an accountant, if you’re a bookkeeper, this is something that can make you vastly more productive, isn’t super complicated, something that you could learn in a month or two if you got serious about it.

But it’s also something that a lot of people don’t learn because you don’t know how, and it seems too difficult, and it does require a little bit of a project. So, this is a good example of something. But it could also be something like learning about a specific topic that’s relevant to your industry. So, if you’re learning about you’re getting into a computer sort of technological field, you might understand a little bit about how that software works, even if you’re not necessarily in a technical role.

ALISON BEARD: Well, I feel like you’ve greatly inspired me to go out and learn something new. If not today than this week, or this year. And I hope you do for our listeners too. Thanks so much for joining me.

SCOTT YOUNG: Thank you so much.

ALISON BEARD: That’s Scott Young. He’s the author of the book Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career.
