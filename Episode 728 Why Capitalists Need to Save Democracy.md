ALISON BEARD:  Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review.  I’m Alison Beard.

Democracy and capitalism.  In the 20th century, we saw both systems spread around the world.  The promise was greater freedom and prosperity for everyone – but is that what we got? Experts are worried, as are Everyday Joes.  They don’t trust big business or democratic government as much as they used to.  They say that both systems are failing.  Wealth and influence are increasingly concentrated, not shared.

So, what went wrong, and how can we fix it?  Our guest today says that it will take public and private leaders working together on both problems simultaneously.  That’s because free markets don’t function successfully without free elections and fair lawmaking.  And democratic institutions need corporate support to survive.  She argues that you can’t fix one without fixing the other and is calling on the business community to take the first step.

Rebecca Henderson is an economist and professor at Harvard University and Harvard Business School.  She’s the author if the upcoming book, Reimagining Capitalism in A World on Fire and the March Big Idea, “The Business Case for Saving Democracy.” Rebecca, thanks so much for talking with me today.

REBECCA HENDERSON:  Thank you, Alison.  It’s a pleasure to be here.

ALISON BEARD: My first question is, how did we get here?  Why are both capitalism and democracy in crisis?  And I know that’s a huge, big, double-barreled question.  But in broad strokes, where did we go wrong?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  We went wrong because we forgot that free markets need free politics.  Coming out of World War II, the U.S. government was popular and strong.  They’d won the War.  American society was incredibly coherent, very prosperous.  And businesspeople believed that they had a real role tole play in the broader society.

As the decades wore on, businesspeople became increasingly focused on putting their heads down and making money.  Part of that is a function of the shareholder value revolution, which really began in the ‘70s and hit full stride in the ‘80s, the idea that the only duty of the businessperson was to make money.  And in fact, that that was a moral duty, that by maximizing returns for one’s investors, that led to the maximum prosperity for the society and the maximum freedom.

The implicit assumption was that someone else would worry about the democracy.  And that was a problem.  The free market really relies on someone else or something else in setting the rules of the game.  Because a market is only free and fair if everyone can play, if no one can collude to keep out new firms, and if everything is properly priced.

And the best entity to set those rules is a freely, democratically elected government, to make sure the rules are fair.  In some circumstances, the easiest way to make money, the easiest way to maximize shareholder value is to fix the rules of the game in your own favor, to seek to control government so it doesn’t bug you, lets you do what you want as a businessperson.

ALISON BEARD:  Yeah, and in this current U.S. presidential election cycle, we are hearing so much about the role of government and the role of business, and often they’re pitted against each other.  You know, for one to be strong, the other has to be weak..

REBECCA HENDERSON:  I think that’s fundamentally mistaken. I think free markets only really thrive in the presence of strong government, democratically accountable, transparent, responsive government that can do two things.  It can make sure the free market stays free, so everyone plays by the rules.  And it also makes sure that what we call public goods, like education and health and opportunity, are available to everyone.  One of the things we’ve seen in the United States over the last 20, 30, 40 years, is that for the people at the bottom, rates of social mobility have really fallen.  In the U.S. today, less than half the population can hope to make higher wages, higher salary than their parents.  They’re downwardly mobile.

ALISON BEARD:  And that’s happening not just in the US, but in other parts of the world, too.

REBECCA HENDERSON:  It is happening in other parts of the world.  It’s worse in those parts of the developed world which adopted what we might call Anglo-American capitalism, or a single-minded focus on shareholder value.  So it’s worse in the UK.  It’s not so bad in Canada.  It’s worse in Australia.  It’s not so bad in Denmark.

But where business did nothing but ruthlessly focus on the bottom line, a whole swath of the society seems to have suffered.  I mean enormous wealth was created.  But it wasn’t evenly distributed.  And because government was getting weaker and weaker, because so many businesses said, we don’t need government, we should drown it in the bathtub.  Let’s cut taxes.  Government wasn’t doing its job.

ALISON BEARD:  And a lot of your book talks about things that companies can do on their own within the walls of their own organization to improve the state of capitalism, serve their employees, protect the climate by cutting their emissions, etc.  But you’re arguing for something greater here.  You want them to actually step in and bolster public institutions, too?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  I do.  I know this is a really controversial suggestion.  A lot of people think, it’s never going to happen.  I mean, when I was trying to sell my book, I interviewed a very famous publisher in New York, and he looked at me, and he said, Rebecca, business saves the world? Do you read the papers?

So for some people, the very idea that business should step up and try and do something about the democracy is either ridiculous or dangerous.  Ridiculous, because business is selfish and evil and is just going to take care of itself.  And dangerous because if business does step up to save democracy, well, what’s the difference between saving democracy and owning democracy?

I really understand both those concerns, and I think they’re real concerns.  Why should business step up?  Well, first, because they have a very strong business case.  Because what we’re looking at now is massive social unrest.  And the gradual destruction of our institutions.  I think in many parts of the world, you can see countries sliding towards populism.

And populism, per se, is not a bad thing.  It’s people getting really angry because they’re not getting what they need.  So I understand that impulse.  The trouble with aggressive populism is, it leads to populist governments.  And populist governments lead to authoritarian governments.  They lead to crony capitalism.  They lead to the elites taking all the wealth and power for themselves.  And that’s not the free market.  And it’s lousy for most businesses.

A few businesses do great, because they’re in with the people running things, and everybody else is on the outside.  So I think there’s a strong business case for business to step up.  Business is being asked to do all kinds of things that they probably shouldn’t be asked to do.  I mean, to raise wages, to invest in education, to take care of climate change, these are tasks that are much better addressed by government.  In my book I suggest that business should try doing them, because governments aren’t stepping up, and we’re in a desperate moment.  But it’s much better for business to be able to rely on a strong government to take care of that stuff.  And then business can put its head down and make money.

ALISON BEARD:  Yeah.  But as you said, you’re asking businesses to make a really big change in their mindset.  You know, we’re going from powerful lobby groups, in the United States, to supporting institutions that might increase regulations, increase taxes.  So how do you get corporations to flip?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  You’re right.  I’m asking businesses in a way to put down their weapons, to disarm, and to strengthen their opponents, to strengthen the regulators, to help create a strong voice for labor and employees, to strengthen the free media, to strengthen the courts, to give government more expertise so they can regulate more effectively.

And I, believe me, I really understand.  I sit on two corporate boards.  And the idea that like, wait, Rebecca, you’re suggesting that we should strengthen government and labor and media, like – what?

So here’s the issue.  We are in a very bad place.  The country is incredibly polarized, and it’s not just the US.  We’re seeing a rejection of the so-called elites right across the world.  A majority of people in the world now say the system isn’t working for them. We’ve got a wholesale rejection of the system that made us rich and free.

ALISON BEARD:  And that typically leads to revolutions.

REBECCA HENDERSON:  I think we’re in the midst of a slow-moving revolution.  And I think it’s really dangerous.  And yes, I’m asking business to disarm and to strengthen the people that can kind of provide a counterweight to it.  And I’m doing it because I’m saying, it’s really good for the whole system.

And I know that that and 25 cents will get you a cup of coffee.  So, let me tell you what I tell a businessperson.  What I tell a businessperson is, first, this is going to be good for your business, because your employees increasingly care about these issues.  So firms, for example, that are lobbying for a carbon price, they get benefits.  You know?  Employees are really excited that, hey, my firm is trying to do something about climate change.  A firm that gives everyone a day off to vote, or works with the local mayor in the city to try and strengthen the educational system.  A firm that comes out against a flood of money into politics.  If you ask a random sample of people of the ideas they really care about, a vast majority of Americans favors getting money out of politics, because everyone can see that’s corrupting the process.

I’m not suggesting that individual firms try and change the whole democracy.  That’s never how it’s been done historically.  I don’t think it’s going to work now.  What I’m suggesting is firms work together, through their regions, or through their industry associations, to strengthen the system.  And that’s happened before.

ALISON BEARD:  You say in your book that government institutions are necessarily bureaucratic, and businesses hate that.  So how do you overcome that hurdle, or opposition to putting all of this responsibility into an institution that maybe doesn’t run it as efficiently as the private sector would?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  What you need is a free democracy to keep them honest.  You need to be able to throw the bastards out.  You need to be able to insist that they employ real experts and meet real deadlines.  And if they don’t, you get rid of them.

I think there was an intellectual mistake made in the sort of ‘50s and ‘60s, which is, government is about tyranny.  Government is the Soviet Union.  Government is the ownership of the means of production.  No, no, and no.  Government is a free people coming together to govern themselves.  And to set the rules so that they’re fair.  And to invest in the things that the whole community has to invest in.

And when you look at where growth has come from across the world, there’s overwhelming research evidence that where the society has grown most quickly and most innovatively, they have free institutions – strong media, strong labor, strong politics.  So yes, government is sometimes bureaucratic and sometimes imposes rules.  And sometimes firms move too fast and cut too many corners.  That’s an intrinsic conflict.  There’s no way to get rid of tension.  In a crazy way, a healthy society is one where there’s fighting all the time, but it’s not fighting about the fundamental rules.

ALISON BEARD:  Most of us would agree that businesses should be able apolitical.  So how do you make sure that they’re supporting institutions but not particular ideologies?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  Oh, this is such a fabulous question.  And let me just make the question harder.  Because I’m a big fan of businesses pushing for carbon policy.  And that’s a particular policy.  That’s not about the democracy.  I justify it by saying that a carbon policy is essential to ensure the market is really free and fair.  That when you have a massive pollution like this that isn’t being included in market signals, it’s everyone’s duty to push for it.  But still, I mean, how would I feel if all the firms got together and started to push for, I don’t know, every employee should have a drug test every week, and a depression test, and if employees are depressed, we should force them to take medication.  I mean, like, no.  So where is that line, and how do we hold it?

I’m a big fan of the idea that firms should be explicitly purpose driven.  That is, that the goal of a firm should be health and well-being of the society and that making money is a necessary route to that goal.  Now, that just might sound like a whole lot of talk.  But the example I use is child labor.  No one would argue in public that employing children is a good thing to do because it’s profitable.  And increasingly, nobody would argue in public that, well, I discriminate because it’s how I make money.  Hey, you know, don’t bug me about it.  People will say, no, discrimination’s just the wrong thing to do.

I think that subverting the democracy should just be the wrong thing to do. A subset of the fossil fuel companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fight against the decarbonization of this society.  And they’re pumping money into local areas, under the guise of local grassroots campaigns.  And they are not only subverting the free market, because they are selling a product that is not appropriately priced, and that is causing the deaths of millions of people, but they are absolutely subverting the democratic process.  And that should not be OK.  When they go to cocktail parties, people should look at them and say, yeah, we need oil and gas, and the transition is tough, but what are you doing?  You know?

Most people want a carbon policy.  Most people want to decarbonize.  I personally think it’s an existential threat to the long term health of our society.  It’s a massive risk.  What are you doing?  The other thing that’s really important, and this is why I keep saying, business should strengthen the other institutions, and it should do it collectively, and it should do it transparently.  dream of the day the Chamber of Commerce goes to Congress and goes to the American people, and says, you know, gerrymandering is a problem.  Everyone should have a vote, one man, one vote.  We should have no restrictions on ballot access.  Why don’t we have a day off to vote?  Why isn’t that a national holiday?  Why isn’t there a federal standard for voting, so voting is free and fair everywhere?  Why don’t we have automatic voting when you get your, you know, there’s a whole bunch of things.

But they say it publicly.  They say it collectively, so it’s not single firm arguing in its own interest.  And then we talk about, is that OK?  Is that the appropriate role for business?

ALISON BEARD:  So what’s the first step, if you were talking to a CEO roundtable, what’s the first thing you would want them to do to strengthen our democratic institutions around the world?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  I would ask them to stop running down government in public.  To stop talking about government as only the problem.  And to start talking, just talking, about the fact that strong democratically accountable governments are central to the support of really successful capitalism.

ALISON BEARD:  And are there corporate leaders who you think are already doing a good job of that and more?

REBECCA HENDERSON: There are corporate leaders doing a good job of talking about it in private.  You know, it’s really tough being a CEO.  You have a business to run.  You have to make payroll.  Everyone’s coming at you all the time.  You don’t really have strong incentives to singlehandedly go out and fix democracy.  But you do have the opportunity to talk to other CEOs in your industry or in your region, and you do have a responsibility to tell your industry association to play by the rules. And you can talk to your employees about the importance of voting – how who they should vote for, not what political position they should take, but about the fact that you think that civic participation is fundamental to our society.  So, and lots of CEOs are starting to do that.

ALISON BEARD:  And what advice do you have for companies that are working in undemocratic societies and multinationals that extent to those countries?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  Firms that work in undemocratic societies are often viscerally aware of how much less effective and less efficient they are as places to do business, how much smaller the markets are.  So they’re sort of a living, breathing laboratory about why we have to hold onto our democracies as strongly as we can.

In those kinds of places, the first thing I think that firms can do is to not play the corruption game.  And again, that has to be done together.  Right?  It’s much easier to avoid paying bribes if all my competitors also refuse to pay bribes.  Right?  If I go in to try and sell you a bridge, and you say, well, you know, I love the bridge, but I need a little fee for, you know, my children, and I say, no, we don’t do that.  If you can turn and ask someone else, and they’ll pay the fee, then you know, we’re up a creek.

Another big thing, and I don’t think we talk enough about this, is to try and shut down the flow of dark money around the world.  Because one of the things that keeps nondemocratic governments in power is the ability to pull as much money as they want out of their country and then ship it to New York or London, not just Switzerland. It’s completely possibly to shut down.  But you need to have all the major countries agree to shut it down.  And at the moment, a bunch of people are making money from handling the dark money.

ALISON BEARD:  Yeah, what about China in particular? – Sorry.

REBECCA HENDERSON:  I knew you were going to ask me about China.  So China is so interesting. The Chinese experiment of the last 20, 30 years is one of the best advertisements for the power of capitalism on the planet.  Right?  They brought a million people out of poverty.  They grew their economy at a fabulous rate because they released the power of free enterprise.

So two things.  One, they had a strong government.  They had a strong government that focused on a bunch of the infrastructure necessary for that economy to thrive.  In the Chinese case, the most obvious is the amazing railroads and roads and airports.  So, in that case, strong government went hand in hand with free markets.

But then you’re going to ask me, well, it doesn’t seem to frightfully democratic.  And I think that’s a good summary.  And indeed, China appears to be becoming actively more authoritarian.  As many people have said, they appear to be building the first large scale surveillance state, sort of George Orwell 1984 on steroids, and truly frightening.  So two things may happen.  One, the economy may continue to grow in the hands of a surveillance state, in the hands of an elite that is increasingly concentrating wealth and power into its own hands, and everything we believe about democracy and free markets may be wrong.  But I don’t believe that’s going to happen.

I think when you are not yet at what economists call the production possibility frontier – and what everybody else calls, well, you’re still catching up – so when you have a clear target where you need to go, you know what industries you need to build.  You know what technologies you need to adopt.  You don’t need innovation.  You just need to run fast and do it.  That you can do that under what I call an extractive regime, a nondemocratic regime.  But once you get out to being at the edge, once you get a place where you can’t just take, once you get to a place where you can’t just copy what everyone else has, then you need to innovate.

Everything we know about history suggests that for real innovation, fundamental innovation, you need a democratic regime.  Why?  Because really innovation threatens the existing elite.  Imagine a world in which Kodak controlled everything.  Would digital photography have been allowed to emerge?  Absolutely not.

ALISON BEARD:  So, you’ve talked a lot about businesses cooperating with each other – their competitors – to collectively reduce their wealth, basically.  How does that work in practice?

ALISON BEARD:  Well, it’s to collectively reduce their short-term wealth in the service of the long term.  So let me give you an example not from democracy but from another problem, which is businesses banding together to reduce deforestation.  Roughly ten years ago, the major consumer goods companies became very concerned that in order to product things like palm oil or beef, but principally palm oil, the forests of the world were going down at an unsustainable rate.  And that was creating very significant brand damage for them.  Plus, generating potentially an immense consumer backlash.  What do you mean my lipstick is contributing to the death of the orangutans and the warming of the planet, and whoa.

And so they came together through the Consumer Goods Forum, and said that we will act together, and we will only buy sustainable palm oil.  And that’s a short-term hit, because sustainable palm oil is more expensive than dirty palm oil, or conventionally grown palm oil.  But if everybody agrees to do it together, no one is at a disadvantage from that happening.  And they were all very strongly focused on the long-term benefits of making the switch.

Now, it didn’t work.  It didn’t work because they didn’t persuade the Indians and the Chinese to join.  And so, there was still palm oil providers that could sell palm oil produced by cutting down virgin rain forest to willing buyers in other markets.

And so, now what you’re seeing is those same consumer goods companies looking at each other and going, you know what we need to do?  We need to strengthen government on the ground where palm oil is grown, in Indonesia, in Malaysia.  We need to support local governors, local mayors who want to take their area of the country and make it sustainable.

ALISON BEARD:  So it’s the impending crisis that is going to force cooperation?

REBECCA HENDERSON:  That’s what I believe.  You know, sometimes people say to me, oh, come on, Rebecca, this isn’t going to happen.  The examples you give are all at times of immense stress.  Right?  And I look at them, and I say, and what do you think’s going to happen if we don’t do anything different?

ALISON BEARD:  Right.  Scary.

REBECCA HENDERSON:  It’s scary.  And so I’m trying to persuade people to act ahead of the crisis.  And I know that’s super hard.  I know how busy everybody is.  I know people have to make money.  But the cost of waiting for the crisis is so great.  And if we start to move now, I think we can generate, I think we can build a much better world for our children.

ALISON BEARD:  So, let’s say I’m not a CEO.  I’m not.  Let’s say I’m a senior executive or even a front line employee.  Is there anything I can do to help my organization reimagine capitalism and support democracy?

REBECCA HENDERSON: So, the first thing you can do is get politically active.  And support politicians who favor strengthening the democracy.  And there are such politicians in both parties.  Find the politicians who are willing to say, we need more conversation in the middle.  We need rank choice voting.  We need everybody to vote.

The second thing is to raise these issues at work.  Now, you don’t show up at work on Monday morning and go, oh, let’s remake democracy.  No, no, bad idea.  But you can look around the firm.  Where are those places where acting in better ways is in the interest of the firm?  The term that’s out there is shared value.  Where can you help the firm make money, yes, but also make a difference in the world?  Probably local to start with.  Maybe larger.  All the firms that are out there in the headlines as, we are making a difference in the world, we’re great, I’ve worked with many of those firms, and it all started with people on the ground saying, you know, we could change the light bulbs.  You know, we could improve the efficiency of the trucking fleet.  You know, we could treat people differently, and productivity would improve.  You know, if our city was better run, we would be better off.  So that’s where ideas come from in organizations. They come from people on the ground who see the opportunities and build coalitions.

You know, if there are firms who are doing bad stuff, and there are firms out there doing bad stuff, don’t go and work for them, and don’t buy their products.  And tell other people.  Because that’s real power.  We need an avalanche.  None of us individually can start an avalanche.  There are nearly, what, seven billion people on the planet?  And none of us individually can do anything.  But individually, we can be the pebbles that make the avalanche.  And so, my goal in life is to be one of the pebbles that starts the avalanche that drives change.

ALISON BEARD:  Terrific.  Rebecca, thank you so much for talking with me today.
