ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Alison Beard.

Today we’re going to talk about a phenomenon that most of us are familiar with: moonlighting side hustles, second jobs. We typically think of these things as an escape or distraction from real work, something people do at night and on weekends because they need the money, hate their organization, or dream of doing something totally different with their lives.

But today’s guests say that any ambitious professional needs a sidegig – not for cash or fun or as a backup plan, but to enhance their existing careers. They think these extra projects and jobs should be meaningful and strategic and they say we have to learn how to find them and fit them into our busy schedules.

Ken Banta is the founder of the Vanguard Network and Orlan Boston is a partner at Ernst & Young. Together, they wrote the HBR article, “The Strategic Sidekick”, and they joined me. Now, welcome.

KEN BANTA: Thank you, Alison.

ORLAN BOSTON: Thank you, Alison. Good to be here.

ALISON BEARD: So how exactly do you define strategic? What makes for the right kind of sidekick? Orlan, why don’t we start with you?

ORLAN BOSTON: It’s actually something that is strategic – meaning, it is well thought out, that you’re deliberate about why you took it on in the first place. It tends to check off a number of boxes. One, are you passionate about it? Two, are there things that you can learn from and develop as a leader from? And can it benefit your organization or your day job in some way?

ALISON BEARD: But this goes beyond simple things like training courses or networking, right?

KEN BANTA: Yes, I think it would, you know, those things are valuable. But this is really taking things to a higher level where you’re initiating the effort and becoming much more deeply engaged in a work product or work project.

So just to give one example I could have taken a course in how to lead groups which I felt I wanted to develop. But that would be a little mechanical. So instead, on joining area not-for-profit board, I chose to also volunteer to be one of the co-chairs, meaning that I would be not only leading discussions in the board, but leading decision-making. And that’s proven very valuable for me in a lot of different ways. It would be hard to duplicate that through a course.

ORLAN BOSTON: Yeah. I would take it one step further as well, which is when you take courses I mean, oftentimes you’re going to take those with folks that are probably already in your industry perhaps in your same job. When we talk about strategic side gigs we’re really trying to stretch ourselves into areas that frankly we may be uncomfortable in because we don’t necessarily have that experience.

So it could involve everything from advising startups in a particular field that you may not have a lot of experience in, but you may have some parallel experiences that could be valuable to that entrepreneur. It could involve creative endeavors whether it’s producing documentary film or it’s writing a book on a topic that you want to learn more about and collaborating with folks who are experts in those fields. But at the end of the day, I think it really is about stretching yourself as a leader, as a person.

ALISON BEARD: And why is it so important to learn and grow outside your organization? Especially when that means that the bosses who are deciding on your promotion or pay aren’t actually seeing the development happening?

KEN BANTA: It’s actually true in some cases that those bosses may not appreciate the outside learning that you’re doing, the strategic gig aspect. And that can lead to another set of questions as to whether that’s the right organization for you. But typically, you’re going to learn so much more externally than you will internally. A good leader will see that value that’s being created by your external activity.

ORLAN BOSTON: Yeah, I think, you know, it’s important to keep in mind that with the pace of change in the outside environment in the world today, it is very difficult for academic institutions, corporate learning departments to keep pace with that change. I mean, by the time you are learning within the four walls of your company those topics oftentimes are already becoming irrelevant and obsolete. And so you have got to compliment it with outside engagement.

ALISON BEARD: Yeah. When you’re a rising executive, it can seem really hard to take your eye off the ball. aren’t there risks to distracting yourself?

ORLAN BOSTON: You know, I actually think that the risks of not engaging externally are actually larger than the risks of internally engaging. Right? So, yes, as executives and as leaders in organizations many of us are in very challenging roles. But if we stop at the boundaries or the borders of our four walls, there’s so much that we’re going to miss out on. And that’s the, that’s what you’ve got it compellingly convey to your boss.

KEN BANTA: I think is executives, leaders go higher in their roles in the hierarchy, the more and more apparent it becomes that they need other capabilities than those that they gain simply by doing what they’re doing harder and faster. And I’ve personally spoken with a lot of CEOs as part of the work I do on leadership development and it’s remarkable how many of them say that they got where they are in, in part or even in large part by having focused on external activities that develop them in ways they couldn’t have developed in the company. So I think it would certainly seem to be right that you weren’t, you should lock yourself in your office and work harder and harder, but it’s actually somewhat counterintuitive that you should not do that and get out.

ALISON BEARD: Okay. So let’s say that our listeners want to do this. How do they decide exactly what their gig should be if things aren’t falling into their laps? Where do they start?

KEN BANTA: I would suggest and I guess this has been my own experience. What I’ve done is to think ahead to where you want to be with your career or with your work. It may not be in the same field. In the end, you might have an ambition to move. Well, those calculations should go into your three-dimensional diagram of what you should be focusing on.

So, you know, again in, in a case where someone knows that they are, let’s say in R and D and they have a very heavy technology or science background, but they don’t really have a whole lot of experience in how to lead people laterally or how to work within a corporate structure to get decisions made. Then I think what you’d like to do is create a list of attributes that you’d like to  develop. And then from that work on what those sidegig opportunities should look like. And it comes back to what we talked about earlier, that it’s not only not a bad idea, it’s a good idea to do this collaboratively with the person you work for. They may help you also identify where you have needs for development that you may not recognize. And then that takes you one step closer to what those things or what that thing should be.

ORLAN BOSTON: I think it’s equally important to start with what you’re passionate about. I think one of the worst things you can do sometimes is to take on a role in an area that you’re just not passionate about. And I think that’s especially important with non profit board opportunities.

So I always tell folks who ask for this advice to start with something that you’re passionate about because if you’re starting with something you’re passionate about you’re going to bring a certain energy and sincerity and authenticity to that organization that will benefit you and will benefit them. And then I think when you start from there with sort of the goal in mind, then you can whittle down sort of the list of potential opportunities that that you want to pursue.

ALISON BEARD: Do you find those opportunities through the people at your own organization, through your network?

ORLAN BOSTON: I found that it’s a combination of all of those. Right. So you’ve got to put the word out. You’ve got to let the people that you know in your organization and outside of your organization that you’re interested in perhaps taken on a board opportunity at a nonprofit and be a bit deliberate about what kinds of opportunities in what areas around what causes and what you would bring to those boards. Because that way folks will remember that conversation they had with you and keep you in mind and reach out to you and say, Hey, could this be something that makes sense for you?

KEN BANTA: One thing I recommend that is a little counter typical approach is to networking if you like which would rely on people, you know, and organizations, you know which is very valid. I think it can also be very relevant to reach out cold to organizations that you think you’d like to learn more about and ask one of their executives or leaders to have an informational interview with you or discussion. And sometimes that leads to something new. I’ve had that happen several times.

ALISON BEARD: So this to me is the real difficulty. How do people who are already busy with work and family responsibilities find the time to take on these meaningful strategic, extra jobs?

ORLAN BOSTON: That’s the question that we most often get.. I mean, we’re all very, very busy not only in our day jobs, but also with our families. Right. And so you gotta start with something that you’re passionate about. There are creative ways that you can approach that by, you know, everything from blocking off, you know, hours on your calendar. You can involve the people who were important to you or that you want to spend more time with, whether it be your friends or your spouse or family members. Or you can oftentimes involve folks on your team at your day job who are also looking for opportunities – folks that want to develop their own skills. And so by involving them, sometimes you can leverage yourself and find more time that you otherwise wouldn’t have found.

So a good example is Karen Medoff Barnett, and she’s the executive director of the American Ballet Theater, and she’s a mother of three girls, ages 10, eight and four. And she’s been involved with a number of outside activities over the course of her career. Everything ranging from being involved with the American Theater Wing and on the Council on Foreign Relations. And as you can imagine with three kids, she really needed to involve her spouse and sort of set those boundaries together with her spouse. Over the course of her career, she said that she’s had to say no. But she’s also said not now too many groups and she’s been deliberate about her schedule and how she spends her time. But what she said, which to me really stood out was that the key is being present in the room that you’re in, whether as a mom, at home with your kids or at the job with your employees or with the cause of nonprofit or the board that you’re involved with.

KEN BANTA:  We are all busy, but are we productive?  It’s a kind of badge of honor for people who are executives to be incredibly busy.  And they’ve got 12 hour a day jobs, and so forth and so on.  But honestly, most of the time, if they were to really analyze how they spend their time, they find that they probably have three to four hours out of that 12 that they could basically open up if they just were either more efficient or stopped doing things that don’t matter so much.

So, what I’ve found about this side gig concept is that it also helps to force people to truly evaluate what matters and what doesn’t in their day.  And it’s remarkable how much of what you do each day doesn’t matter quite as much as you thought.  And if you really are even a little bit rigorous about that, you can crack open some time for something that really matters.

ORLAN BOSTON:  You know, and can you incorporate it into your day job?  Can you have a conversation with your boss, and actually set that as a goal, that you know, you want to build board experience by serving on a nonprofit board. And all of a sudden, you’ve got the support of the organization.  You’ve got the support of your boss.  And perhaps there are even resources that you can tap into from your company that would be helpful in achieving that goal and serving on a board like that.

ALISON BEARD:  Yeah, if your boss is initially hesitant, how do you make the case?

ORLAN BOSTON:  So sometimes you’ve got to ask for forgiveness rather than asking for permission from your boss.  And get it going.  Right?  And when it gets to that point where it’s a real opportunity, then you’ve got to think about how you have that conversation with your boss, and you want to, again, tie that to how that’s going to make you a better leader in your day job?  How is that going to make your company better?  How does it align to the mission, the purpose, the values of your company?  Is that going to bring you or your company access to innovation that they otherwise wouldn’t have.  I think you’ve got to use that judgment depending on sort of the culture at your company and the nature of your boss to sort of decide when to do that.

ALISON BEARD: Because surely sometimes people take on these side gigs, and it actually results in them changing careers.

KEN BANTA:  Yes.  And that’s a good thing, too. It’s not only, how do you get yourself into a better position within your existing company, but often, how do you position yourself to be doing something completely different?  And that’s absolutely valid.

ORLAN BOSTON:  There was a great example of that in our article, where Amit Paley, who is a CEO and executive director for the Trevor Project, was a McKinsey consultant at the time, and had gotten quite excited about consulting and advising to nonprofits, and so got very involved in McKinsey’s nonprofit consulting arm and got connected to the Trevor Project as a volunteer.  As someone who would take those calls from kids in crisis.  And that ultimately merged into a Board opportunity where he served on the Board of the Trevor Project and after a couple years it actually turned into a real job as the Board was looking for a new CEO.  They found that they had the perfect candidate sitting on the Board.  And so, yes, it can actually turn into a job, real job changes and career change opportunities.  Although that’s not necessarily what we’re advising to do, but yes that can happen.  I think that can be very positive for folks.

ALISON BEARD:  So, let’s flip to the organizational point of view, the manager’s point of view.  If I’m the boss, how do I support people in doing this?

KEN BANTA:  I think one of them is that to play a role in helping someone gain better self-awareness of what they are good at and what they need to, want to improve on.  That’s one aspect.  Also to help them become better aware of what their future goals are.  And in my case, I benefitted from leaders who have said look, you are talking about wanting to do a sort of very conventional thing because that’s the conventional track, but maybe you’d be better off doing something differently.  A good boss starts this discussion with helping the individual to develop that self-awareness.

ORLAN BOSTON:  I think it also helps when that boss is doing that, him or herself.  Whether they serve as role models of being on boards, or having pursued outside activities.  Now that always happen b ut if that’s not happening then it’s creating an environment where it’s OK.  Where they’re encouraging their employees to again, look for opportunities that align and are consistent with the values of the company.  Putting this into their goals – e valuating them, rewarding them.

ALISON BEARD:  And have you seen organizations institutionalize any of this?

ORLAN BOSTON:  So, KKR is a global, private equity firm and the program that they instituted was called 40 for 40, which gives employees 40 hours of pay time each year to serve at nonprofits that they feel passionate about.  And that was a program that Ken Mehlman who we featured in the article talked about quite a bit.  Another example actually at my firm, EY, our programs called EY Ripples.  We rolled that out about a year ago and that encourages our employees to get involved in pro bono engagements with nonprofits that EY has identified as, nonprofits that we want to support through pro bono support.  And so, we’ve taken that step further and actually connecting our employees to these sorts of opportunities.

KEN BANTA:  There are some examples, but not a lot actually.  And it’s an interesting question whether an institutionalization of this is necessary, or not.  It certainly can be valuable in a place like KKR.  Obviously it’s been working very well.  But once you turn something like this into a kind of corporate process it can often get processed to death.  So, in my mind anyway, this really does require some initiative by the individual and not necessarily the program that’s served up to them in the organization.

ALISON BEARD:  Does this work as well in other countries, or cultures that aren’t quite as entrepreneurial as the United States?

KEN BANTA:  That’s a really good question.  I think it does depend a great deal on the culture that you’re in and I don’t have any evidence for it, but I suspect that it works better in some places than others.  For example, in cultures that have a place of high degree of value of conformity and on doing things by the rules. this is going to be a little harder to see taking root.  Whereas in more free-flowing places and where entrepreneurial environments are, I think it’s more likely to succeed.

ORLAN BOSTON:  My sense and from what I’ve seen and talking to a lot of folks is that probably Western culture, this is a bit more accepted, although interestingly enough, the article got quite a bit of play in Asia, specifically in India where Ken and I got a lot of response from a social media perspective.  What I would imagine and what, well what I think is that in places where it may not be as commonly accepted, it’s still going on.  It’s just that these companies don’t know it.  And many employees are doing this secretly basically.  And so what we’re saying is you know what?  Let’s open that up.  Let’s be honest about it.  Let’s be strategic about how you approach those and bring those outside engagement activities into the fold with your day job.  Because when that happens, it’s mutually beneficial for your day job, your company, the cause that you’re involved with and for you as a leader.

ALIOSN BEARD:  Yeah.  So, we’re obviously in the middle of a crisis.  We’re all taping this from our respective homes, in an economic downturn that might last for some time.  Is any of this possible in our current moment?

KEN BANTA:  You know, I was thinking about that too just before we started our conversation.  And I think the answer is absolutely yes.  There’s so many things that are happening that are negative, but there’s also a lot of things happening that have a lot of promise.  And one of the things that got huge potential is linking in and connecting with people electronically in ways that weren’t so common before.

So, obviously the Zoom culture that we’re in suddenly has a lot of downsides to it, but one of the plusses is that you, it’s much more acceptable to engage with a person outside the organization to find out what they do, or how the organization works, or whether you might be able to help in some way.  And it’s remarkable I think how much faster you can create a relationship in that way versus waiting a few months to set a meeting over lunch or something.

The other thing I think that it’s pointed out to me is something that’s kind of obvious with people who are either millennials or people who are at least that age today, whatever, however you want to look at it.  But I think they’re very impatient with conventional structures and career paths and other elements of corporate life and business life.  And so I think that this period is somehow liberating people to think even more creatively about what they really want to do with themselves.

ORLAN BOSTON:  It seems like this has really struck a chord particularly in this environment.  Where folks have a bit more time to sort of reflect on their current lives, their careers and how they want to spend their time going forward.  If you’re already involved in some of these things, well doing them virtually has at least for me, personally has been fairly seamless for the nonprofits that I’m involved with.  But even when you’re seeking those out, I think the same advice applies, right?  Putting the word out about your interests.  Letting folks who you know, who serve on these boards, letting them know can you help?

ALISON BEARD:  Yeah.  So what are each of your favorite side gigs that you’ve taken on in your own lives and how did they help you?

KEN BANTA:  One of them is the board work I mentioned before with a not for profit, but focuses on solving for homelessness versus sheltering people, really solving for it.  And I was really passionate about the cause, but then I really developed a sense of purpose around learning how to be a co-chair of a board of an organization like that because I wanted to really draw on my own ability to lead, sometimes lead from behind. Perhaps the  more situational leadership perspective.

And so that’s been a tremendous asset for me in a whole lot of different situations since then.  The other thing that I did that I felt very strongly about is consciously taking on a series of mentees from my own undergraduate college.  And that certainly is a good thing to be doing in itself, but I think what I purposely wanted to learn was really how to help others develop themselves and that kind of a coaching sounding board fashion.  And that’s really become very valuable in my current work that I’m doing in increasing amount of advising of C-suite leaders on their leadership.  And doing it in a very, I’d say sort of interactive way and more as a, again more of as a sounding board, providing them with a series of steps one through five to success.  And that’s proven really beneficial for me and also really interesting.  So it’s been, again been an element of passion to the work I was doing, but then the payoff has been in my own work.

ORLAN BOSTON:  I’ll give you a couple as well.  The one from a while ago was a coffee table book project that came my way through a friend of mine who’s a fashion photographer who had published coffee table books in the past and he told me that he wanted to do one on environmentalists and really portray them and show different sides of what environmentalists of today look like, and feature their causes.

And one day he called me sort of in a panic because the reporter that he had lined up to interview Fabien Cousteau for the book, fell through.  And so he said would you mind doing the interview and I at first thought, well what do I know about sustainability and environmentalism.  And how can I interview one of Jacque Cousteau’s grandsons right.  Then I thought, well I’m a manager consultant.  I interview executives all the time. Let me get smarter about the topic and so I did that.  And I did that interview and all of a sudden it went well.  And that led to me doing more and more of those.  And so I sort of fell into this, this book project where I got the chance to interview folks like Ted Turner, and Mike Bloomberg, and Bobby Kennedy Jr, and Jane Goodall and I mean just a whole host of fascinating folks.

And what I found by getting involved in what was a coffee table book project actually helped me become a better interviewer, learn more about a topic that I didn’t know much about, which was sustainability, which I was interested in learning more about.  Build confidence and engaging with world figures.  And so, that was a fun project because it definitely tested me in ways that I wouldn’t have been tested at the time at my current job.

And more recently, I’ve gotten involved with Goldman Sachs launch with GS, which is a social impact fund.  It’s about a half a billion dollar fund that is exclusively investing in women, Black and Latino owned startup companies and entrepreneurs.  Because women get access to less than three percent of all the venture and growth capital out there.  And Black and Latino founders get one percent of all of that.  And so they assembled this advisory board of entrepreneurs and investors of color and I was asked to join that.  But once I understood sort of the cause and what they were trying to do which was move the needle on an issue that is really important, and I was very passionate about, I made the time to say yes.

ALISON BEARD:  Well terrific.  Thank you both for talking with me today.  I really appreciate it.

ORLAN BOSTON:  It was our pleasure.

KEN BANTA:  Yeah, thank you so much and this has  stimulated some thinking for me anyway as well on top of what we’ve already done in this area.

ALISON BEARD:  That’s Vanguard Network founder Ken Banta and Ernst & Young partner Orlan Boston, coauthors of the article “The Strategic Side Gig.”  You can find it in the May/June issue of Harvard Business Review or at HBR.org.
