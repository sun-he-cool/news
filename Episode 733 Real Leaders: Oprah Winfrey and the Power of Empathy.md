ADI IGNATIUS: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Adi Ignatius. This is “Real Leaders,” a special series examining the lives of some of the world’s most compelling and effective leaders, past and present, with lessons for all of us today. This week we are ending our four-part series with…

OPRAH WINFREY: Oh, my goodness. I’m at Harvard.

ADI IGNATIUS: Yes, that is Oprah Winfrey, giving the commencement speech at Harvard University back in 2013.

OPRAH WINFREY: Harvard. [LAUGHTER]  Not too many little girls from rural Mississippi have made it all the way here to Cambridge. My one hope today is that I can be a source of some inspiration. I’m going to address my remarks to anybody who’s ever felt inferior or felt disadvantaged, felt screwed by life.

ADI IGNATIUS: I’m Adi Ignatius, Editor in Chief of Harvard Business Review. And I’m here with Nancy Koehn, the great historian and professor at Harvard Business School. Nancy has written a case study on Oprah Winfrey’s life as an entrepreneur and as the leader of a media empire. Hello, Nancy.

NANCY KOEHN: Hey, Adi.

ADI IGNATIUS: And Nancy that’s not the only time Oprah visited Harvard. She also came to your class at HBS, right?

NANCY KOEHN: I taught the case for the first time in I believe 2005. I talked to her on the phone twice at great length and all of her top staff —

ADI IGNATIUS: In researching the case —

NANCY KOEHN: In researching the case at Harpo, which was her production company that created and produced The Oprah Winfrey Show. We had asked her, very carefully, with the right protocol, if she would come to class on the day I planned to teach the class. And she said, “I can’t come. I’m somewhere else.” And that morning, my assistant called me and said, “I just got a call from the guard’s booth at the parking lot. Oprah Winfrey has arrived in three huge black SUV’s.” And so I get there way early, and there she is sitting in the sky deck which — for our listeners — is the top row of the Harvard Business School amphitheater classrooms, with her producer, her chief financial officer, her make-up artist, her hair person, and three more top people in her circle. She spoke for about 15 unscripted minutes and then she took questions. And she was astounding. She was smart. She was warm. She was serious. She knew how to take a tiny story as a metaphor and turn it into a life lesson or extraordinarily powerful takeaway for the students. And I think even some of my very, very skeptical male students, who were like, “Why do we think of Oprah Winfrey as being worth a Harvard Business School case?” And I’ve encountered much of that over the many years I’ve been working with this material. Even they, most of them, were like, “Wow.”

ADI IGNATIUS: So a little content setting about Oprah’s early life and how it shaped her. I mean what’s unusual for her is that she talks and she doesn’t hide and she brings people in. But there’s probably a reason why she’s talking about this stuff, so —

NANCY KOEHN: So, she was born in 1954 in a small town in Mississippi, poor family. And her parents shortly after her birth separated. They went different ways, and she spent the first say 10 years of her life moving back and forth between her parents. Her father moved to Tennessee. Her mother moved north to Milwaukee. Her father became a barber and built a relatively stable domestic life in Tennessee. Her mother did not build quite such a stable life. The most important part of this existence, shuttling between homes and very different environments [and] circumstances across many miles, was that she was abused sexually as a young girl. And what pretty quickly happened with her, now I’m repeating her words is she started to make trouble. She said, “I could have gone in a different direction and basically become a problem child, a juvenile delinquent.” Before she became an adolescent, her father basically said, “I’m going to take my daughter Oprah and she’s going to live with me in Tennessee.” And that was a more stable life for her, and she credits her father and his decision to try and bring her to Tennessee to live with him with being a very important moment of redemption and opening up a much better fork in the road for her. And so she spent her adolescent years, her high school years in Tennessee and eventually went to college in Nashville. That was the runway into college where she got interested in radio and then television. But she’s talked at great length about the scars that were left for her emotionally and physically. Eating disorders and some drug use, very limited, but drug use as a result of the emotional burden she carried — the legacy she carried of the sexual abuse. But all of it turned out to be part of the road that Oprah would travel as a television celebrity, which was, “My life is my classroom. Your life is your classroom. We’re all on a journey of self-development. Let me tell you where I started.”

ADI IGNATIUS: All right so let’s fill in a little of her early professional bio. Oprah starts her career at a local TV station in Nashville while she’s still in college. She becomes the first Black female TV correspondent there. Then she gets recruited by a Baltimore station to co-anchor the 6 p.m. newscast. So this is 1976. This is a huge move for her career. But it doesn’t go well. After two years she gets demoted to co-host a local morning show, which actually turns out to be something of a breakthrough.

NANCY KOEHN: Yes, it does because she discovers in a talk show that she can be much more authentic, she can be much more herself, and she realizes, “I found the right place for my work here.”

ADI IGNATIUS: All right. So things are looking up for Oprah. People are starting to notice her on that morning show in Baltimore, and then she gets a call from Chicago.

NANCY KOEHN: She does. Dennis Swanson at WLS-TV in Chicago, hires Oprah to host their morning talk show, A.M. Chicago. The show is a hit, and they quickly rename it The Oprah Winfrey show.

RECORDING OPRAH WINFREY SHOW: You tried every new drug in therapy and still can’t get any relief from the disease or affliction you have, but did you ever think relief could lead to be right inside your own mind? On the next Oprah Winfrey Show, meet the bestselling author of . . . [fades out]

ADI IGNATIUS: So this is a long time ago. The Oprah Winfrey Show started in the mid-80s, so it’s hard to remember what life was like before that. But this thing takes off. Can you explain what this was like when she was experimenting with the format and how it just kind of took off?

NANCY KOEHN: If we parachuted back to the mid-80s and Oprah being recruited to come and do a talk show in Chicago, Chicago A.M., we would see a landscape of television talk shows that look quite a bit different. There were a few women that had done something like television talk shows, like Barbara Walters, but most television talk shows were Meet the Press. There weren’t television shows or other venues in the mass media that were primarily about emotional issues or primarily about difficult life experiences, in which talking about something like even divorce was common. The only exception to that, and this is important for the Oprah story, was Phil Donahue who was really in his own way a path breaker. He was the first person in any kind of talk show and almost any kind of television live format to talk about divorce. He talked about the difficulties of being Catholic. He talked about birth control. All of those topics in the early 1980s were generally considered verboten — you know, forbidden. And what happens is really quickly she out Donahue’s Phil Donahue by orders of magnitude. And within, you know within a quarter, a season, she’s bested him in the Chicago market — by the ratings calculator. And then she’s off to the races, so to speak, with this new format in which she’s going to vastly expand the spectrum of acceptable topics for a talk show. She’s just going to blow it up. And she’s going to, by doing that, with great immediate success in terms of audience reaction, first in Chicago and then nationally — because pretty quickly there are calls and interests in moving her national and syndicating the show. And pretty quickly she’s going to start laying the groundwork, if you will, for all kinds of talk shows that today we can consider absolutely standard fare.

ADI IGNATIUS: So Oprah has said that her empathy, I guess, kept her from being a good journalist. That, I guess that means that the cool detachment that at least, in the past, we thought of as necessary for serious journalists to do their job. Just didn’t suit her. She couldn’t report on the devastating crisis and keep her emotions and everything out of it. Let’s talk about her, you know, the need to be true to yourself. I mean that’s not always easy to do  – both professionally and socially — to say, “My personality’s not suited to this so I’m going to take a different path.” As you look at that decision, how do you think about the decision she made and can anyone else make a decision like that?

NANCY KOEHN: I think the way she came to that decision was that she got moved from more hard news, this is in Baltimore, this is the stepping stone to Chicago and the beginnings of what would be The Oprah Winfrey Show in the mid-80s. She got moved because she had so much empathy, she wasn’t able to stay so cool and detached from hard news to a talk show that she was co-hosting in Baltimore. And she said after the first show, “Oh my God, I felt like I came home.” So she stumbled into it. It wasn’t that she started off thinking, “I have this empathy, this is who I truly am. I need to do something that’s aligned with that.” She stumbled into it. She had this realization, and that’s the direction she started to steer her own ship in. And it turned out to be a very smart decision.

ADI IGNATIUS: So I feel like probably Harvard Business School, certainly Harvard Business Review, we talk a lot about the need for a high EQ and empathy. That that’s what makes good leaders. On the other hand, the narcissists seem to be doing pretty well, too. So maybe empathy is a trait we’d like. Does it necessarily correspond to good leadership? I mean good leadership looks different depending who it comes from.

NANCY KOEHN: I think the unbridled narcissists may end up with power. We know they do. History proves that right. That’s not the same thing as worthy leadership. Worthy impact. I’m a historian. History judges. It’s the nature of looking at the past. There are very few unbridled, unabashed narcissists in history that we look back and say, “Wow. They were great leaders.” Because great leadership turns out to correlate, as we now understand, pretty highly with self-development. And that means transcending pure, raw, unsheathed narcissism.

ADI IGNATIUS: One thing and I don’t know if this is you know, push back on the Oprah mystique or not. But like Oprah Magazine, O Magazine. Not only is her name on the magazine, her picture on the magazine. Her name and picture are on practically every page in the magazine. That seemed, to me, almost the definition of narcissism — as opposed to this kind of selfless, purpose-driven sense that people have about her when they talk about her. I’ve never been able to square that exactly.

NANCY KOEHN: I think what she understands is that people are interested in identifying with her. And people’s ability to say, “Oh Oprah’s learned that. I can learn that. That’s relevant to me.” Yes, is it narcissistic? Sure, we can frame it that way. But its purpose is not primarily to make Oprah more glamorous or Oprah more excited about herself. I don’t think it’s primarily about a quest for validation that is the primary driver of clinical narcissism, right. The quest for validation in the face of a deep innate sense of unworthiness. That is not, I think, what she’s up to in the world. I think what she understands is my brand is all about me and my life and how people pick away at that and use it and peel away things for themselves. And that is how she’s basically navigated her leadership journey.

ADI IGNATIUS: Coming up after the break, we’ll talk about some of Oprah’s high profile mistakes, how she handled them, and what we can learn from that process.

ADI IGNATIUS: Welcome back to Real Leaders, a special series of the HBR IdeaCast. I’m Adi Ignatius, with Nancy Koehn. Hey, Nancy.

NANCY KOEHN: Hey, Adi.

ADI IGNATIUS: So as I think about Oprah and her life and try to draw lessons from it, it’s hard because in some ways she is unique. She’s this person who has had so much success, has made so much money, has had so much power and influences. And yet, people seem to think, “Yeah, she’s like one of us.” There aren’t a lot of people that you can say that about. So let’s look at Oprah Winfrey, businesswoman for a second. What lessons would you draw from the way in which she has grown and developed her business empire?

NANCY KOEHN: One, this incredible ability, back to empathy, Adi, to understand where your audience is headed before they even know themselves. Emotionally, practically, spiritually, she’d say. You know, Howard Schultz — lots of great entrepreneurs, Estee Lauder, lots and lots of great entrepreneurs that developed really interesting innovative market-making products, did this. She’s in a different business, but it’s completely analogous. She’s in services, media, entertainment, education, self-development. But she knows before her customer knows. In a sense, we can learn that you can lead on the demand side if you have very good antennae for understanding your audience and your potential audience. That’s the first thing. Second thing, she’s exceptionally strategic about how she built her empire, her pillars of influence. So she starts with a television show. She’s very, very calculated about, “What’s our portfolio of shows across five days every week?” They don’t do five days of how to pick a comfortable high heel. They do a very interesting mix. So Tom Cruise comes on one day, and then we do a show on campaign finance reform or money in politics. And then we do a show on how to buy a bathing suit. And then we do a show on climate change. And then we do a show on managing your sugar intake. So she’s been very calculated about what she offers, in what combination. That’s just like organizing the shelves of your store. Great merchandizing. The third thing I think that’s really important is within her show, she’s chosen these very interesting vehicles — all with her name and picture in them — that are really important, like the Book Club. The Book Club didn’t start off to create best sellers. It started off to create this peace of individual activity that Oprah thought was important, literacy and getting people to read books. And so she created a book club that then becomes its own kind of engine for authorial success. Um, Oprah’s Favorite Things. That was Oprah’s idea that every once in a while we’re going to talk about “something I really love that you might love too.” Like a celebrity endorsement. And that became again, this vicarious “ooh!” — almost like a fashion magazine or a sports player saying, “I love these Nike basketball shoes.” So that was a piece of it. Then her magazine, when she starts to broaden her media footprint. The television and movie production. All these occurring, not in the kind of walk step chronology, but in this more organic sense of where do we need to be to keep people interested and to build our audience. And then of course, her own website that really became the prelude to her getting interested in her own television network, The Oprah Winfrey Network, OWN Network. So she’s been very, very good at what we’d say at the Harvard Business School, leveraging the brand, acquiring or creating like assets.

ADI IGNATIUS: Her show was also, from early moments, sort of purpose-driven. Uou know, that’s table stakes now. Oil companies are purpose driven. Tobacco companies are purpose-driven, everybody’s purpose driven. But there was sort of a standard, “This is appropriate for the show. This isn’t.” Even as she was sort of breaking down barriers.

NANCY KOEHN: Absolutely. That was something that she from the very beginning thought, “Why are we doing this show? What’s the purpose?” She said in the case when I interviewed her, she said, “I never go downstairs to tape a show. Any kind of media appearance that I don’t have a conversation by myself alone, I need time alone, and I say, what’s my intention here? What am I doing here?” So this very conscious, very emotionally aware set of software that she’s developed in herself and is using or calling on in order to advance what she sees as a worthy goal. And there’s this moment that she described in my class and in the case, where she said, “I realized early on that we hadn’t thought about how low we could go in terms of what we would explore. And when I realized that we actually had to set limits on acceptable topics, everything that was emotionally intense, or that had been forbidden and now we were going to try and discover whether it wasn’t, was not OK.” And she says, “I remembered this. I realized this. One day at a break in the show, we were interviewing Nazi sympathizers, members of a Nazi youth group. And they were talking about the uses of violence. And at the break in the show” — when they tape, I’ve seen the show taped a couple times. They stop and the camera stops rolling and the audience takes a breath and anything goes then because you’re off camera. She said, “The young men started doing high fives to other people in the audience. As if – Yeah, now we’re getting our message across!” And she said, “That was it. I realized — there’s a floor beneath which you don’t go. And we were enabling, empowering, a message we actually didn’t really want to get out.” So, she changed the game and then she realized how you change it and how much you change it and where you draw lines is really important. And she backed up and said, “We’re going to be real careful about the subjects we cover.” And that continued for the rest of the run of the show, and I think it’s been something she’s been very diligent in thinking about in the ensuing years.

ADI IGNATIUS: I think if you look at her career you can find examples of missteps, of empowering new voices on her show that, whether it’s medical quackery or your example, that doesn’t look good in hindsight. What’s interesting with her though is that she has often owned it. Actually one of the great examples is James Frey’s memoir, A Million Little Pieces, which she recommended. She has this incredible power. She recommends a book, and it is a best seller. I’m not sure there’s ever been an exception to that in all these months and years. It turned out memoir was largely made up. She initially sort of doubled down defending that book and defending him. And so that’s a mistake. But what’s interesting is when she makes a mistake, and people point it out, and she realizes it, “OK that was not good.” She knows she has the power, “Alright, let’s have a national conversation about that.” And her power, I guess, both to convene and to be a kind of moral authority — there aren’t many people who have that, or who have had that. And she completely changed the conversation and, you know, in a sense put the book publishing industry on notice that you can’t be so sloppy with what you define as a memoir because we’re actually paying attention. We’re actually rallying people to say, “No, we’re not OK with this.”

NANCY KOEHN: You’re right. I mean she starts off by apologizing, saying, “I was wrong.” Let’s not underestimate the power of that self-acknowledgment to then begin this conversation that she has. So it’s not, “Oh, this was really Nan Talese, right, the person, the editor who was in charge of A Million Little Pieces.” This is, “Let me begin with, I was wrong. I should have done better fact, we should have done better homework on this book before I embraced it. And there’s some other issues here. Let’s get down to publishing. If you’re publishing memoirs that are fake it is not good news.” I think part of her power is about her willingness to apologize and say, “How do we make this better next time and avoid this mistake?”

ADI IGNATIUS: So it’s kind of what you do with that power. There is that Oprah effect. She has this army of people who will buy what she suggests, will read the books she suggests —

NANCY KOEHN: March on Washington.

ADI IGNATIUS: Will March of Washington, if that’s said. Who really take her cues. Not in a, well maybe in a culty way — but not simply in a culty way. And that is sort of the test of leadership. “ OK, you have that power. You have access. What do you do with that?”

NANCY KOEHN: I mean, you’re answering the question. I think you’re absolutely spot on, Adi. I don’t think she has made very many moves, including the missteps and the apologies for those, where she doesn’t own the responsibility of the power. Now we’re living in an age when in all kinds of spheres, from government to religion, to business — lots of leaders with lots and lots of power don’t own the authority. I mean the great debate now [is] what will Big Tech, the most influential companies in the world and in our lives and in our polity, from Amazon to Google, to Facebook, to Apple. What will these big companies do with the extraordinary authority and power that they have to affect everything from the environment to wages in towns where there are Amazon fulfillment centers? What will they do with that power? Will they own the social, environmental, political responsibility that is inescapably, irrevocably attached to that power?

ADI IGNATIUS: So, help me understand the concept of Oprah Winfrey as leader. I mean she certainly has been incredible, a pioneer, really reinvented the talk show format, a very successful business woman. You’ve written about Abe Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ernest Shackleton and people who were, you’d say, “Oh yeah, that fits my standard definition of leadership.” Place Oprah, then, on that spectrum.

NANCY KOEHN: So let’s go back to David Foster Wallace’s definition that I use a lot and that we’ve referenced in this series around effective leaders as individuals who help us overcome the limitations of our own weaknesses, laziness, selfishness, and fears, and get us to do harder, better things than we can get ourselves to do on our own. Oprah Winfrey has done that in spades for most of her life as a media figure, as a talk show host, as a speaker, as an entrepreneur in her company and her choices about distribution channels, as an author. That’s what she does. That’s what she’s interested in. She’s interested in, “How do I help people do the hard work of becoming their better selves?” And she would say “their best selves.” That’s a term she likes a lot. I know from teaching this case in scores of venues — I can’t tell you the hundreds of people that over the years have raised their hands to tell a story about how Oprah made a positive impact on helping them or their family members. You know, the son in my MBA classroom who said, “My mother has said for 10 years she could never have gotten through a horrific divorce without Oprah’s inspiration and Oprah’s guidance.” There are millions of people who consider her someone, I think with good justification, who’s helped them do harder, better things than they could have done on their own. That’s all aside from “If Oprah can do it, maybe I can do it,” which is the role that lots and lots of leaders play as a kind of unacknowledged inspiration or North Star for people.

ADI IGNATIUS: So Nancy, this episode concludes the first run of this special series, “Real Leaders.” I have to say these conversations have been a total pleasure for me.

NANCY KOEHN: And for me as well, Adi.

ADI IGNATIUS: You studied all these people a lot. I guess I’m wondering if you’re analyzing someone’s life and something happened — someone in the family died and then their life turned out this way, there’s a temptation to say, “Well their life turned out this way because their parent died.” How do you deal with trying to extract real lessons as opposed to what somebody could say is cherry picking from the life stories of these important leaders?

NANCY KOEHN: Well you begin with trying to reconstruct the journey as carefully as you can. You don’t go down the byways and highways that they didn’t travel. So there aren’t any what if’s. You follow the bread crumbs of their paths. And then over that process, which is really all about detective work, inevitably something really interesting, and what I’ve learned, something really relevant to today, emerges. And that’s the essence of the work. That’s the essence of a historian’s craft.

ADI IGNATIUS: And is there some way, let’s take the four episodes that we’ve done where you would say, “OK, these four leaders are all alike in some fundamental way?” Or is every story and every journey unique?

NANCY KOEHN: Well everyone’s journey is unique, but there are themes or threads that connect these four. And I think one of the most important is that consciously or unconsciously each of these people, early on in their life, decided to get better, to work on themselves. And then using that learning, to make a positive impact on the world.

ADI IGNATIUS: And some of this comes back to the point you made a few episodes ago, which is that the greatest leaders in the world are not born that way, they are made.

NANCY KOEHN: They are made, and a lot of it is self-making. We can all get better by working on ourselves and by using our experiences as classrooms or as petri dishes for that learning.

ADI IGNATIUS: So as we wrap up this mini-series, I want to thank our listeners for tuning in. Nancy and I hope to return before long with more episodes, profiling more leaders and their lessons.
